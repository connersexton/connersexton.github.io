*The following post contains a collection of excerpts from a final project I worked on with Kevin McMorrow for the course, Exploratory Data Analysis, during my Junior year at Wesleyan. This project displays use of several data management and visualization techniques, as well as the statistical approach of Exploratory Factor Analysis.*

## Introduction

In recent years, Cannabis use has steadily moved away from the taboo and into the mainstream. Studies have shown promising results regarding the drug’s efficacy in treating a wide variety of ailments ranging from epilepsy to PTSD. With its increased acceptance, Marijuana has brought with it a plethora of interesting data. Consumer data, strain genealogy, and cannabinoid breakdowns have all proved to be valuable and interesting avenues for further research. In conducting this study, we hope to be able to further understand some of the technical jargon that surrounds the plant. More specifically, we hope to make sense of the relationships between Indica, Sativa, and Hybrid strains–and their respective effects. Additionally, we’d like to take a broad look at the dataset to get an idea of trends in the cannabis market.

**Guiding Questions:**

- How do flavor and effect influence the user rating of a cannabis strain?

- How do strain types (indica, hybrid, sativa) differ in terms of flavor and effect compositions?

- Are there underlying factors within the data? If so, what are they?


## Data Description

Our data was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/cannabis-strains), which is an aggregated dataset of information scraped from the website, [Leafly.com](https://www.leafly.com). The dataset provides information such as strain type, rating, reported effect, reported flavor, and description, on 2,350 unique Cannabis strains. These variables are categorical with the exception of the rating variable, which is nominal.

## Data Preprocessing

In terms of data management, we focused primarily on the variables, *effect* (strain effect) and *flavor* (strain flavor). Both variables in their raw format were composed of comma separated strings, which list each observation's respective flavors and effects. To perform factor analysis, we converted these columns into two separate document term matrices, which displayed a binary (1,0) value for each strain, across each of the 13 unique effects and 49 unique flavors. The diagram below depicts an example of how the input and output of this transformation looks:

The code for our data management on the effects column is as follows:

```r
## Replace commas with spaces
df$Effects <- gsub(",", " ", df$Effects)

## Create a corpus of text from the effects column:
library(tm)
df_corpus <- Corpus(VectorSource(df$Effects))

## Set text to lowercase
corpus_clean <- tm_map(df_corpus, tolower) # set text to lower

## Create document term matrix, then convert to a dataframe:
DTM <- DocumentTermMatrix(corpus_clean)
effects <- as.data.frame(as.matrix(DTM))
```

## Descriptive Statistics




## Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)

#### A Brief Introduction to EFA:

To reiterate, the Kaggle dataset includes an effects column and a flavors column, which contains 13 and 49 unique values, respectively. Considering the vast range of terms used to characterize the flavors and effects of these strains, we chose *exploratory factor analysis* because it "looks for a smaller set of underlying or latent constructs that can explain the relationships among the observed variables" (Kabacoff 2011). What EFA assumes is that there are underlying factors that "'cause' the observed variables" (Kabacoff 2011). In our case, these would be factors that underlie the 13 effects and 49 flavors observed in our dataset. The following diagram, provided by Professor Robert Kabacoff, depicts two underlying factors that are assumed to characterize the given variables, X1 through X5, with corresponding errors, e1 through e5, which represent the variances in X1 - X5 that cannot be explained through factors 1 and 2.

#### Visualizing the Factors from our EFA Analysis:

The example below shows a radar plot produced using the [ggradar R package](https://github.com/ricardo-bion/ggradar) developed by Ricardo Bion. First, we summarized the data frame from our EFA analysis, computing the mean values of each factor across each of the three strain groups. We then rescaled these values to standardize the factor values, resulting in the data frame, graph.data. The code below reflects this process for the cannabis effect factors, but the process for flavors is identical.

```R
## Summarize data for graph
fa.effects %>%
  select(type, relaxing, focus, hunger,
         faded, solitary) %>%
  group_by(type) %>%
  summarise_if(is.numeric, funs(mean)) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(-type),
            funs(rescale)) -> graph.data

## Graph radar plot with graph data
library(ggradar)
library(scales)
ggradar(graph.data,
        grid.label.size = 4,
        axis.label.size = 4,
        group.point.size = 5,
        group.line.width = 1.5,
        legend.text.size= 10,
        legend.pos = "bottom") +
  labs(title = "Effects") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

## Discussion

Our findings (generally) fell within our expectations. The majority of strains caused happy & relaxed effects, and rarely evoked talkative or aroused feelings. Additionally, most strains exhibited “earthy” and “sweet” flavors. Through factor analysis, we were able to conclude that the effect and flavor profiles of hybrid strains fell neatly between indica and sativa strains–as was expected. Considering the increased acceptance of cannabis in the mainstream, our findings would likely have few implications for future policy. Instead, our research could have meaningful implications for market analysts, recreational/medicinal users, and dispensary owners. With the type of analyses that we conducted, individuals could easily find strains that are similar in effect, flavor, and user rating. Dispensaries could prioritize those strains with higher popularities, and search for similar cannabis strains to stock.

In regards to further research, we believe that an analysis of the user reviews could be both interesting, and valuable. Our dataset only provided the user ratings (on a scale from 1-5), despite there being thousands of lengthy strain-reviews left by Leafly users. These reviews could lend themselves to sentiment analysis. Additionally, we could use these reviews to extract the more nuanced effects, flavors, and attributes of the strains. For future research, we’re also interested in the chemical breakdown of these strains. Researchers have posited that strain-type (indica, sativa, hybrid) is an ineffective attribute to determine the effect/“personality” of a specific strain. Instead, it is suggested that one examines the cannabinoid makeup of a strain. The most important cannabinoids in determining the strain’s effects are THC (the psychoactive component) and CBD (the therapeutic/medicinal component). Getting ahold of this sort of data would be incredibly useful in our attempts to classify, summarize, and cluster large amounts of cannabis strains.

Finally, if we were to conduct this sort of study again, we would likely limit our analysis on user-rating to those strains with greater than, say, 25-50 ratings. Our dataset contained a large amount of strains that were new to the Leafly website/database, and thus had <5-10 user ratings–whereas older, more prevalent strains had several thousand.
