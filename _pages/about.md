## Senior Year Capstone Projects:

Anthropology: "Playing in the Sacred: Applications of Neo-Durkheimian Theory in the Context of a Contemporary EDM Festival"

Applied Data Science (in progress)

I am currently working on a semester long project involving Facebook's political advertisement platform leading up to the 2020 U.S. general election. The goal of this project is to provide more transparency in how Facebook is charging different candidates and third party entities through its bidding and ad delivery systems. I am using text analysis and bayesian inference to estimate cost-per-impression across presidential candidate and 3rd party entity Facebook advertisements. I am working under the guidance of Professor Pavel Oleinikov (Wesleyan QAC) and Professor Erika Franklin Fowler (Wesleyan Media Project).
